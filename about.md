I'm {{ site.time|date: "%Y"|minus:1993 }} years old. I study
Automation Control and Robotics at [AGH-UST](http://agh.edu.pl/en), and 
I program a lot in Python.

## My projects

I have a number of projects that I worked on over the years:

[Ganeti Web Manager]
:   web interface to the Ganeti cluster. Helps with all kinds of administrative
    tasks. Removes necessity of using a command line.

[AMY]
:   a workshop management tool for Software-Carpentry.  Helps administrators
    with their burden of managing workshops, finding instructors, and keeping
    all information up-to-date.

[MMVD]
:   a real-life example of operational research algorithms implementation.
    It's a warehouse with robots looks like
    [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWsMdN7HMuA).

[BEng]
:   my Bachelors in Engineering project: a remote emergency switch for electric
    vehicle. Project includes my thesis/dissertation (in Polish), Arduino
    programming files, connection schemas, behavior logic graphs (in Polish),
    and perhaps other files too.
