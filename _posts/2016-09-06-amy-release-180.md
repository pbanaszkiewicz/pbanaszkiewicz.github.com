Major AMY [v1.8.0][] release was tagged. As you can see below, it was
definitely focused on fixing bugs.

## New Features

* [Aditya][] provided a template change that displays link between closed
  workshop request and corresponding event.
* [Aditya][] hid survey-related fields on Event-related forms.
* [Chris][] sped up (again :-) ) tests.
* [Chris][] removed unnecessary help text for autocompletion fields.
* [Aditya][] refactored delete views to use `DeleteViewContext`, essentially
  making code more DRY and easy to change.
* I added deleting entries from bulk-upload feature.
* I updated [DataCarpentry](http://datacarpentry.org) self-organized workshops
  registration form.

## Bugfixes

  recent changes he made on that model.
* [Aditya][] changed display of some `Membership` model fields.

  event details page, instructors by date and in workshop staff finder.
* [Aditya][] changed a uniqueness constraint on `Task` model + added some other
  small improvements.
* [Chris][] fixed non-working links and corrected ordering in all trainings
  page.
* [Aditya][] refactored internal URLs file to use nested URLs structure and
  therefore made it a lot more readable.
* [Chris][] made "progress" column in trainees view wider
* [Aditya][] hid from import instances that were decided not to be imported
* I fixed error message on faulty bulk-upload process.
* I fixed a double-display of unpublished and published views in very specific
  circumstances.
