A minor version [v1.5.3][] of AMY was released two weeks ago and I failed to
post a proper release notes since then so here it comes.

## New features

Now it's easier to add person to the database if they already submitted
a profile update request.

This is specifically useful for admins if they want to add one person and can
contact them to get more details (like affiliation or airport).

## Bug fixes

* [Aditya Narayan][] fixed Django template tags autoescaping on the revision
  page (ie. each page the changes log links to)
* [Aditya Narayan][] again fixed "Update from URL" functionality that didn't
  update event's URL in specific conditions.

Thanks a lot, Aditya!
