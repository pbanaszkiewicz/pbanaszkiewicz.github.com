I'm really pleased to announce that [NumFOCUS][] – [Software Carpentry][]'s
parent organization – was accepted to [Google Summer of Code 2016][].

I will be mentoring for any of Software Carpentry's [projects][] that will get
a student.  Right now we have 3 proposal of our own, but we accept new
proposals from students.
