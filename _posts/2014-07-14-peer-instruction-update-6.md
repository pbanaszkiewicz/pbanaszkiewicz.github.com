I missed one post last week and this one is already delayed by two days
(compared to my typical writings that appeared on Saturdays).

Fortunately, I have good excuses.

First, I wanted to get something done. Second, I was buried under
real-life super exhausting stuff like post-exams leisure. ;)

Progress
--------

Okay, good news: [Pitt](https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz/pitt) has new
interface:

And I'm in the middle of rewriting JavaScript code (again...). Now the
code uses good JavaScript patterns (and I don't consider myself a JS
newbie anymore).

I separated application logic code from application appearance code.
Overall, the code should be easier to understand for newcomers and a lot
easier to maintain.

The list of issues is updated and available
[here](https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz/pitt/issues?labels=&milestone=&page=1&state=open).

I'm also starting to think about Software Carpentry Sprint that takes
place on July 22-23. I'll post some update soon...
