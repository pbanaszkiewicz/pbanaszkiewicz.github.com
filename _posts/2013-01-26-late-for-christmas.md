I know, I know. Christmas was one month ago. But I though I'd share my
personal favorite christmas tree me and my roommates made.

We used empty pizza box (Capricciosa was the choice, I believe), about 14
green LED lights and Netduino platform.

I mainly took care of soldering almost all the pieces together, and my friend
wrote small application able to turn on and off random lights, or make
a little lightshow.

Here should be photos. Enjoy like we did!
