Google Summer of Code 2012 has begun and I’m one of participants. I have
to admit, I was **thrilled** when I found out.

My project is to bring metrics (like CPU, RAM, disk, net usage), alerts
and graphs to the cool [Ganeti Web Manager] by [Oregon State University
Open Source Lab].

For metrics collection I decided to use [collectd] daemon. It’ll be
backed up by my soon-to-be-born [collectd-ganeti] plugin.

Collectd will be installed on the host (Ganeti node), and this plugin
will gather usage information from KVM (and later Xen). This way there’s
no need to install collectd on every virtual machine Ganeti creates.

Next to collectd, I’m going to create a some kind of network daemon,
which will monitor and send metrics data to GWM. For now I created
something very [pre-alpha] – no—one should use it.

Following weeks are going to be very important to me. Not only will I
get my final exams results, but also there will take place university
admission. And Google seems to want job—interview with me.
