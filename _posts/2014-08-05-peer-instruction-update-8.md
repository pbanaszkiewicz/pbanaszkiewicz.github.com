[Google Summer of Code is coming to an
end](https://twitter.com/pbanaszkiewicz/status/494488422837268482).

There's still so much work to do on Pitt I'm sure I'll be working on it
after the GSoC 2014 is done.

Before the soft pencils-down date I want to release one last version,
[v0.5.0](https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz/pitt/milestones/v0.5.0) (this
week) and then work on documentation improvements (probably will release
additional
[v0.5.1](https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz/pitt/milestones/v0.5.1)
then).

Features not coming into Pitt this Summer
-----------------------------------------

Sadly, there's only so much I can do... A few features won't make it
into Pitt this GSoC:

1.  **Hard**: better broadcasting mesh (students act like relays /
    proxies), read more at
    <https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz/pitt/issues/22>
2.  Etherpad integration -- Greg Wilson told me that Etherpad right now
    is not in best condition so this one is postponed
    (<https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz/pitt/issues/23>)
3.  Peer2Peer file sharing -- something exactly like ShareFest
    (<https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz/pitt/issues/21>)

Features coming into Pitt
-------------------------

1.  Mobile-friendly interface (at least for tablets) and fixes for
    non-full-HD devices
    (<https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz/pitt/issues/18>)
2.  Voice-only connections improvements -- as long as I'm able to test
    them (<https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz/pitt/issues/19>)
3.  Chat (<https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz/pitt/issues/20>)

I won't write summary post until after the firm pencils-down date. But
let me say that this Summer was truly awesome :)
