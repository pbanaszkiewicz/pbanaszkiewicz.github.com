I'm studying *Automation Control and Robotics*, a major that doesn't say
clearly what a person would do after graduating it.

From time to time I talk with people who either think I'm studying programming,
or that I'm going to build robots in the future.

## What is Automation Control and Robotics?

Most people don't know what automation control is, so they focus on the part
that sounds familiar: *robotics*. They automatically assume I'll be building
robots like

or [these](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=humanoid+robot).

Well, *I won't*.

My studies concentrate on things like control systems (think of it as
[SCADA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCADA)),
[optimization methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization),
[control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory), electronics,
specialized electronics (FPGAs, embedded systems, assembler programming,
industrial-class robots), leverage of
[stochastic methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic#Manufacturing)
in industrial process identification, computer vision,
[PLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller) programming,
and others.

As you can see, I was mostly balancing between engineering and very specialized
computer science. There really was very little robotics during my Bachelor's
studies.

## What can you do after graduating?

I like to call it: engineering.

People graduating automatics control and robotics are vast-minded, and ready to
work in pretty much any engineering field that has something to do with
programming:

* we can set up wind-turbines
* or air control systems
* or nitrogen refill systems
* or fine-tuning of power plants
* or building assembly lines

There are thousands of options, all different kinds of industries.

## Do I enjoy these studies?

Contrary to many of my friends, I do enjoy studying automation control and
robotics.  I learned a lot of engineering- and maths-related subjects, and
I have hopes for a great work in future.
