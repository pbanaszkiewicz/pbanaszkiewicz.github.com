After another two weeks of development and two weeks of delays, we're finally
releasing AMY [v1.7][] and a bugfix [v1.7.1][]. This post is a joint changelog
for both of them.

## Release v1.7

This release is especially interesting since:

1. it includes mostly Aditya's and Chris' PRs
2. it includes two big PRs containing the biggest part of Aditya's and Chris'
   Summer projects.

### New features

* [Chris Medrela][] helped check for missing migrations in automated continuous
  integration service [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
* [Chris Medrela][] sped up Travis-CI checks of AMY's test suite by using
  a cache directory
* [Aditya Narayan][] as part of his
  [Summer work](https://blog.narayanaditya.in/) added titles and URLs to task
  objects in AMY (useful feature for PyData conference integration)
* [Aditya Narayan][] changed form for creating new events so that admins can
  assign themselves to a new event while creating it
* [Aditya Narayan][] added a `Sponsorship` model to AMY and integrated it with
  AMY (we can now track sponsors for events)
* [Aditya Narayan][] migrated `Host` to `Organization`: it fixed some naming
  inconsistencies
* in v1.6 we dropped support for numerical event IDs to rely only on slugs
  (e.g. `2016-08-13-Krakow` or `2017-01-xx-Boston`), now [Aditya Narayan][]
  cleaned some remains left in the code from before dropping the support
* I added support for `cancelled` tag used to mark events supposed to happen
  but not happening eventually
* [Chris Medrela][] added instructor training workflow, ie. huge part of AMY
  used for instructor training
* [Aditya Narayan][] added a feature for importing people, events, tasks from
  PyData conference site in a comfortable way

### Bug fixes

* [Chris Medrela][] tracked and fixed an error in part of AMY responsible for
  allowing users to log in with other credentials than user/password
  (currently: GitHub login)
* I fixed an API error occuring in some views (endpoints) when using CSV or
  YAML return format
* [Chris Medrela][] added access to AMY for people in invoicing group
* [Chris Medrela][] replaced entity `&mdash;` with actual char `â€”`
* [Aditya Narayan][] added a contact field on `Sponsorship` model
* [Chris Medrela][] fixed issue with user social integration with GitHub
  getting out of sync
* I fixed JavaScript code responsible for generating dates (it was generating
  e.g. `2016-8-3`, it's now generating `2016-08-03`)

## Release v1.7.1

This release contains mostly bug fixes for features we added in [v1.7][] :-)

### Bug fixes

* [Chris Medrela][] removed an overlooked debugging message alert in one of the
  views
* [Aditya Narayan][] added a cancel button to almost all the forms in AMY
* I added a message to "Apply for Instructor Training" page saying that people
  cannot register for Fall 2016 open-access training anymore
* [Aditya Narayan][] fixed "Import from URL" not working on workshop acceptance
  page
* [Chris Medrela][] fixed some validation issue in one of training-related
  forms
* [Chris Medrela][] added access to admin dashboard in AMY to trainers

### New features

  from previous data format into AMY
