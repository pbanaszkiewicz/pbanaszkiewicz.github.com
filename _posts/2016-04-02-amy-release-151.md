Since my comeback to university for MSc, the development of AMY slowed down.
This past month we had a number of submissions from prospect GSOC'16 students
(yay!) and, for the first time, number of bugs fixed exceeded number of new
enhancements.

Since the number of new features is small, I decided to release a minor version
([v1.5.1][]).

## Contributions by GSOC students

March 2016 held GSOC'16 applications period for students. We had a lot of
students this year and we encouraged them to take a look at AMY and maybe fix
something.  This resulted in a number of good contributions.

## New features

Starting with new features since there's so few of them:

* Greg Wilson extended the `check_certificates.py` command to additionally
  return events people participated in
* [Shubham Singh][] added "Notes" field to instructor profile update form
* [Shubham Singh][] added new tag "hackaton"
* Greg Wilson removed command `check_badges.py`
* I enabled autogeneration of user's username after they're added to the
  database
* Greg Wilson added link to Privacy Policy in the footer.

## Bug fixes

* [Nikhil Verma][] found and fixed "List duplicates" page error when no
  duplicates existed
* [Chris Medrela][] found and fixed 404 page for revision that didn't exist
* Greg Wilson fixed `NameError` in `check_certificates.py`
* I fixed a 500 error appearing when user submitted incomplete form used for
  matching people's names
* Maneesha Sane fixed minimal number of instructors required in our workshop
  request form
* I fixed API renderers (CSV, YAML) not iterating generators but displaying
  their textual representations
* I fixed instructors-num-taught report to include people's names
* I fixed a small typo in the name of post-workshop survey for instructors (it
  was called "pre")
* I made the emails case-insensitive
* I fixed some 500 errors related to event importing.
