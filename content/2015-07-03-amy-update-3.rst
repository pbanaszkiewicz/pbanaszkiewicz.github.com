AMY update #3
#############

After some tough weeks today marks the `v0.5`_ release of AMY!

Here's the short list of what's new.

.. _v0.5: https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/milestones/v0.5

New features
============

AMY!
    We finalized the move from "Amy" to AMY.

Instructors' profiles
    We ask instructors to provide a list of preferred lessons, nearest airport,
    area of expertise and current career stage. While some of that information
    does not land in the database, can now take what we really need in AMY:
    airport, lessons to teach, email changes, and so on.

Nice pagination
    Thanks to work by Carlos Peña, we now have a very nice looking pagination
    bar.  I added some algorithms to make it show sections.

Merging duplicate people
    We can now merge people who appear more than once in our database.

History of changes
    This has some flaws, but we now store history of changes to events and
    persons.  It should help admins a lot, because they demanded it at least
    twice!  This feature makes dashboard look strange (it's very wide), and
    I'm looking forward to feedback from admins if they like it or hate it.

New development database
    Weights at least twice more due to pregenerated initial revisions (ie.
    initial "changes" for all our events and persons).

Fixes
=====

Missing ``make migrations`` command
    Thanks to Carlos Peña sharp eye, we no longer miss that step in the
    installation section.

Sidebar covered messages
    On pages with full width (all events, all persons, etc.) the success/error
    messages would be covered by sidebar background.  Now they're narrower so
    that sidebar doesn't cover them.

Redundant display of badges
    Badges were displayed in two places on person's details page.

Features for v0.6
=================

Currently there's no main theme for `v0.6`_ release.

Exams
=====

I had exams in previous weeks, so they casted a little bit of shadow on this
AMY release.
