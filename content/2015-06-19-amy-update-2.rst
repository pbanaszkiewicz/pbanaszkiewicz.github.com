Today's the deadline for `AMY v0.4`_.  It contains a bunch of usability fixes,
so all our admins should be happy :-)

New features
============

Filtering!
    I couldn't get `DataTables`_ to work properly with our backend, but
    thankfully I found out about `django-filter`_.  It's basically what
    `DataTables`_ is, but works without JavaScript (which in case of our huge
    data sets is a good thing!).  A wide, fluid view was adapted for pages with
    listings (so that we can put filters in the sidebar).  I must admit that
    I like it.

"New" name
    As you might have noticed, we're switching from "Amy" to "AMY", to not
    confuse people with software.

Reports
    Thanks to Greg's work, we now are able to simply report which events are
    missing attendance figures, as well as display how many workshops, learners
    or instructors we have over time.

Success/error messages
    Each successful form save, or each errorneous action will result in
    adequate message displayed on top of the page.

Horizontal layout of Find Instructors page
    You won't have to scroll half of the page to get the results, because now
    the skills take way less vertical space than before.

Search improvements
    You can now search through airports, and search for events by their site name. Also, events ordering was changed: soonest show first.

Deleting objects
    It's possible to delete almost any object we have in the database.

Improvements to bulk-upload
    Greg made the person-bulk-upload useful! And Giacomo used it recently.

Pagination on airports list
    Clicking through our stored airports is now possible.

Fixes to workshop selection for the debrief
    Only events that started and ended in the specific period are going to show
    up.

View/edit icons in object listings
    Two icons now make it possible for admins to view object details or go
    right ahead to editing it.

Event fields ordering
    We reorganized fields on the event detail/edit page. Now the slug is on
    top.

Line wrapping for fields with notes
    Some notes had very long lines, but thanks to CSS3 goodness we can now break-up the words inside ``<pre>`` tag.

Username visible
    Person details page displays the person's username.

Link to event's repository and it's website
    If either is provided, we display the other link too. For example, the
    admin submits only the link to the repository. We parse it and display the
    link to the event's website (because it's way easier to fact-check the
    website than the repo).

**Update 19.06.2015**: I forgot to mention that we moved servers! We're now
using Rackspace VPS and have a very clean deployment, plus we're SSL-only!

You're gonna miss it
====================

Event "published"
    Greg simplified the logic for marking events as published.  So now
    "published" field is gone!

Breadcrumbs
    We decided to drop the breadcrumbs.  They proved to not be as useful as
    I hoped.

DataTables
    Our listings were pretty big (for example if you wanted to load all
    persons at once, you'd be waiting for about 10-20s for the site to come
    up), so to maximize usability we'd have to turn `DataTables`_ into
    "server-side processing" mode.  Basically, we'd have to do all filtering
    and sorting on our end, and that would mean no benefit for us.  So instead
    we switched to `django-filter`_.

Django Admin
    We were not using it at all.

What did not land
=================

I'm trying to figure out a way to automate Eventbrite for admins, but from what
I can tell it's going to be impossible unless Eventbrite changes the way it's
working.  So I'm holding off with creating Eventbrite events, at least for now.

Features for v0.5
=================

From Greg's `ticket <https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/issues/374>`__ we can
gather that most important feature for `v0.5`_ is completing user's preferred
lessons and knowledge domains.
