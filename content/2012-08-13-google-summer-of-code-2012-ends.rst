These 3 months passed quicker than I thought. I'm very glad I had this
opportunity to actually write code, earn money and make something useful.
However, a small group of people who will likely use my code in their work,
and who was supporting me from beginning, is what I'm mostly glad of.

During these 3 months I managed to get valuable experience, find out new
technologies (like Vagrant, Flask) and fulfill most of my project's goals.
I want to sincerely thank my GSoC mentor, Ken Lett, and our sysadmin, Lance
Albertson, for great work, patience and support. I wouldn't do this all
without your help, guys :) Thank you.

Now some highlights of the visible part of my project. `Here are some
screenshots available <http://imgur.com/a/fc7OR>`_.
