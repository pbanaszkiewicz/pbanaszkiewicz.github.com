AMY update #6
#############

:tags: [gsoc, swcarpentry, django, release notes]
:date: 15.08.2015

After another two weeks, AMY `v0.8` was released today.

The list of changes for this release is really small.

.. _v0.8: https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/milestones/v0.8

Bug fixes
=========

* Some workshops that didn't provide a list of instructors or helpers were
  erroring out during `Import from URL`. That was fixed in a v0.7.1 in between
  release.

* Some of location fields (address or venue) and contact field were too short
  for some events.  Their length was bumped to 255 chars.

Feature(s)
==========

This release was focused on integrating main Software-Carpentry `website`_ and
AMY.

.. _website: http://software-carpentry.org/

On the AMY side, I implemented a basic REST API (read-only).

Changes to the website are still WIP: this is a big project and I still don't
get "the whole image" clearly, so the development is slower.

Plans for v0.9
==============

Nothing for now, except `triaged issues <https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/milestones/v0.9>`__.
