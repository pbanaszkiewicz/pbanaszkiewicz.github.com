This time next week I'm going to be after my first ever end term exam
(Physics in this case). Should've started learning to it waaay before...

My Raspberry Pi was finally shipped. I received it over two months later, with
3 weeks delay. So far it works as a server with no content. I hope to buy some
magical wireless keyboard (with touchpad on it) and make my very own media
center.

I've already tested `Xbian <http://xbian.org/>`_ and it worked, although not
as snappy as I hoped. My guess is that SD card I used was too slow.

The next academic semester will be SO HARD. It'll end with 4 horrible exams.
My scientific group `Focus <http://www.focus.agh.edu.pl/>`_ also received
financial grant, so we're gonna build some awesome robot.

All this will make me so much more busy than current, ending semester. Not
good.

By the way: I applied for `PyCon US <http://us.pycon.org/>`_ financial aid,
but the demand was so huge, that they had to give everyone partial funding.
Thus I am not likely to attend this years Pycon. Maybe next year, when I save
some more money. "You can't always get what you want", right? ;)
