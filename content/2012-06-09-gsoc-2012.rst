Google Summer of Code 2012 has begun and I'm one of participants. I have to
admit, I was **thrilled** when I found out.

My project is to bring metrics (like CPU, RAM, disk, net usage), alerts and
graphs to the cool |GWM|_ by |OSUOSL|_.

For metrics collection I decided to use collectd_ daemon. It'll be backed up
by my soon-to-be-born collectd-ganeti_ plugin.

Collectd will be installed on the host (Ganeti node), and this plugin will
gather usage information from KVM (and later Xen). This way there's no need to
install collectd on every virtual machine Ganeti creates.

Next to collectd, I'm going to create a some kind of network daemon, which
will monitor and send metrics data to GWM. For now I created something very
pre-alpha_ -- no---one should use it.

Following weeks are going to be very important to me. Not only will I get my
final exams results, but also there will take place university admission. And
Google seems to want job---interview with me.
