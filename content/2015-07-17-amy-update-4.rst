Today is the deadline and release day for AMY `v0.6`_.

Here's what's new and what's changed in this release.

In-between releases
===================

I was forced to add some hotfixes in `v0.5.1`_ and `v0.5.2`_.

.. _v0.5.1: https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/tree/v0.5.1
.. _v0.5.2: https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/tree/v0.5.2

v0.5.1 included a fix for the name of one of our lessons (was 'dc/spreadsheet',
but it should be 'dc/spreadsheets').

v0.5.2 included a fix for the `round-off error <https://twitter.com/gvwilson/status/620708679529168896>`__ that was crashing AMY.  If you're more interested
on the story, read `this commit message <https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/commit/837be7a8afaf0f957ffc2a61201c9d8544b2dea7>`__.

New features
============

Deletion of tasks
    Tasks can now be deleted from their details page.

Eventbrite link
    Event details page will show link to the Eventbrite's event page instead
    of sole key ID.

Quick link for new airport page
    Accessible from "+" dropdown menu.

Auto-fill end-date on event form
    Setting a start-date for an event will set-up an end-date (+1 day)
    automatically (most of our workshops lasts for 2 days). The auto-fill won't
    happen if user put something into end-date field.

2-column layout on person-details page
    First column contains awards and tasks, while the second column contains
    knowledge domains and lessons person can teach.

Facelifted Find Instructors page
    Full-width layout, filters in sidebar, no setting of "wanted" instructors.
    Using `GET` for filters application instead of `POST` as previously.

Ability to add tasks for person from their edit page
    Now admins can not only assign awards to specific persons from their edit
    page, but also tasks.

Tabs on person edit page
    Because of using 3 forms and 2 listings on the person edit page, the split
    was necessary. The first tab contains original person edit form, the
    second tab contains awards and award-form, the third one contains tasks and
    task-form.

Facelifted bulk-upload
    Another switch to full-width layout.  Confirmation page for bulk-upload will now show what happens with specific entries ("will be created" or
    "it's already in the database" kind of thing).

Lessons sorted by default
    Lessons will appear in alphabetical order in Find Instructors filter and
    also in "lessons" column on that same page.

Importing event from URL
    Admins can pre-fill event create form with data from workshop page.

Improved "failed to delete" page
    Thanks to one small discovery, a big and ugly chunk of code was replaced
    with almost a one-liner.

Fixes
=====

Display of tasks
    Tasks now show links to events and persons.

Eventbrite event ID name change
    Previously it was 'reg key', now it's clearer.

Better fields in airport form
    "Airport name" instead of "Fullname", "IATA code" with link in the
    "help_text" instead of "Iata".

Better list of tasks on person-details page
    These tasks now contain links to related events and clearly indicate roles
    a person has.

Searching for "firstname lastname"
    Searching for "Piotr Banaszkiewicz" now works!

Enforced uniqueness for event slugs
    Having two events with the same slug resulted in a crash, so we decided to
    enforce uniqueness for event slugs.  This not only prevents the bug from
    hunting us, but also prevents admins from adding events with slugs that
    are already in the database.

Awards will prevent events from deletion
    If there are some awards that point to specific event, that event will not
    be deleted.

Plans for v0.7
==============

There are two things that I want to work on for v0.7 release.

1. I want to add `develop` branch and set it as the main branch for the repo.
2. I want to fix `host/site/organizer <https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/issues/5#issuecomment-122214844>`_ representation in the database.

The rationale for 1. is that I had to make two minor releases to v0.5 when
we already had features for v0.6 merged to the `master`.  If we had only kept
stable releases in the `master` (`git-flow`_), I'd not have that problem.
