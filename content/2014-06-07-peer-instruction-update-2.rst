In this week's videoconference between my mentors, Greg Wilson and Mike Hoye,
`Software Carpentry`_'s instructor `David Rio`_, and me, we decided to temporarily drop `my current codebase`_ and what I've done with `Licode`_ and Erizo.

.. _Software Carpentry: http://software-carpentry.org/
.. _David Rio: https://github.com/drio
.. _Licode: http://lynckia.com/licode/
.. _Erizo: https://github.com/ging/licode/tree/master/erizo
.. _my current codebase: https://github.com/pbanaszkiewicz/peer-instruction

Instead, my current efforts will be focused on developing and enhancing David's
`excellent work`_ that uses `PeerJS`_.

.. _excellent work: https://github.com/drio/pitt
.. _PeerJS: http://peerjs.com/

This has some interesting consequences.

Firstly, we can't have broadcasting using MCU in teacher's mode.  Instead, in
this mode, we'll have to open P2P connections, what's probably going to be
quite challenging for teacher's internet connection.

.. note::

    In **teacher's mode**, the teacher broadcasts his stream to all of their
    students.

    In **student's mode**, students are split into smaller groups (6 people
    per group in real life, at most 4 people via Internet - more is less
    efficient) and talk with each other.

But for now we want to ship first version as soon as possible, so we'll care
about that later.

Secondly, we'll have a lot clearer and "closer to the metal" code.  Opening
sockets and handling all data transfers will be much easier, and I like that
fact a lot!

On my personal side of news, I'm currently preparing for exams (first one:
next Thursday), which leaves me very little time for GSOC ``#sadface``â€¦
