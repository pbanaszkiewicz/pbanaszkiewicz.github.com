After this summer work with OSUOSL (during Google Summer of Code) I started
my actually first ever ( ;) ) semester in university. In comparison with high
school, in university everything is simply 3x harder.

Physics is 3 times harder, calculus is 3 times harder, learning all that stuff
is 3 times harder, and even getting up at 8AM is 3 times harder.

Thankfully I have more spare time due to the lack of humanities... STOP!
Nonsense! Someone apparently wiser than me knows that I need **TWO**
totally useless humanity courses. Not that I'm trying to become an engineer,
because I should be fricking Shakespear as well!

Okay, enough rant. :)

I always pursue some additional challenges. This year with a couple of friends
we decided to join `Focus <http://www.focus.agh.edu.pl/>`_ scientific group at
AGH University of Science and Technology. It's primary field of work is vision
systems, including some Artificial Intelligence.

(Apparently I became Focus president, by the way.)

Me and my friends have some idea of a RC car (with Kinect and Raspberry Pi
onboard), ideally autonomous.

My very own Raspberry Pi is on its way from somewhere (Asia?), should get it
in 3---4 weeks. I hope I can compile and use OpenKinect and OpenCV
software on it.

This also means that I'll most probably not use my beloved programming
language Python for some time. :( But what can you do.

Last very imporant news: at yesterday's Google Pizza Event for AGH
I discovered how cool were Google Internships. Now I want to go for one soo
much :)
